# Missing Files for App Store Release

This document outlines files and configurations typically required for a general App Store release that are currently missing or need attention in the `neuanfang-umzugshelfer` project.

## Instructions for AI:

For each item below, if the task involves creating a new file, generate a basic placeholder file with appropriate content and structure. If it involves configuration or external setup, provide clear instructions on how to proceed.

---

### 1. Privacy Policy

**Description:** A privacy policy is legally required for all apps on the App Store. It informs users about data collection, usage, and handling practices.

**Action for AI:**
- **Option A (Preferred):** If a web-hosted privacy policy URL is intended, create a placeholder `PrivacyPolicy.md` file in the `neuanfang-umzugshelfer/Resources/` directory with a note indicating that its content should be adapted for a web page and linked in App Store Connect.
- **Option B:** If the privacy policy is to be displayed directly within the app, create a `PrivacyPolicy.md` file in `neuanfang-umzugshelfer/Resources/` with a basic template for a privacy policy. The AI should also suggest how this file could be integrated into the app's UI (e.g., a new `PrivacyPolicyView.swift`).

### 2. Terms of Service / End User License Agreement (EULA)

**Description:** Terms of Service or an EULA define the legal agreement between the app developer and the user.

**Action for AI:**
- Similar to the Privacy Policy, create a placeholder `TermsOfService.md` file in `neuanfang-umzugshelfer/Resources/` with a basic template. Indicate whether it's for web hosting or in-app display.

### 3. LICENSE File

**Description:** If the project is open-source or uses components with specific licenses, a `LICENSE` file is crucial for clarity and compliance.

**Action for AI:**
- Create a `LICENSE` file in the project root (`/Users/admin/neuanfang-1/`) with a common open-source license template (e.g., MIT License). The AI should note that the specific license should be chosen by the developer.

### 4. CHANGELOG.md / RELEASENOTES.md

**Description:** A changelog helps users and developers track changes between app versions.

**Action for AI:**
- Create a `CHANGELOG.md` file in the project root (`/Users/admin/neuanfang-1/`) with a basic structure for release notes (e.g., version, date, new features, bug fixes).

### 5. Localizable.strings (for Internationalization)

**Description:** If the app is intended to support multiple languages, `Localizable.strings` files are essential for storing localized text.

**Action for AI:**
- Create a basic `Localizable.strings` file within the `neuanfang-umzugshelfer/Resources/` directory (or within a `Base.lproj` if that's the convention) with a few example key-value pairs. The AI should also mention the need for additional `.lproj` directories for other languages.

### 6. Fastlane Setup (Optional but Recommended)

**Description:** Fastlane automates beta deployments and App Store releases, including screenshots, code signing, and metadata.

**Action for AI:**
- Provide instructions on how to initialize Fastlane in the project, including running `fastlane init` and outlining the typical `Fastfile` and `Appfile` configurations needed for App Store submission. Do not create the files directly, as `fastlane init` handles this interactively.
