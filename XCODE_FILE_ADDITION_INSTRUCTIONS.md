# Xcode File Addition Instructions

This document provides instructions for adding missing files to your Xcode project. This is necessary to resolve "Cannot find... in scope" errors, which occur when Xcode is not aware of certain source code files.

## Instructions for Human:

**Problem:** Your Xcode project is not recognizing all the necessary source code files, leading to "Cannot find... in scope" errors during compilation. This is because these files, while present on your file system, are not correctly linked within Xcode's project structure.

**Solution:** You need to manually add these files to your Xcode project through the Xcode interface. Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Open your project in Xcode.**

2.  **Add Files to Xcode Project:**
    *   In Xcode's Project Navigator (the left sidebar), locate the existing groups (e.g., `Models`, `Services`, `Views`). If a group doesn't exist, you can create it by right-clicking on the parent folder (e.g., `neuanfang-umzugshelfer`) and selecting "New Group".
    *   For each file listed in the "Files to Add" section below:
        *   **Right-click** on the corresponding group in Xcode (e.g., for `PersistenceController.swift`, right-click on the `Models/CoreData` group).
        *   Select **"Add Files to 'neuanfang-umzugshelfer'...".**
        *   In the file selection dialog, navigate to the file's location on your disk.
        *   Select the file(s) you want to add.
        *   **CRUCIALLY, in the options presented in the dialog box (before clicking "Add"):**
            *   Make sure **"Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED**. (The files are already in your project directory, you don't need duplicates).
            *   Make sure the **`neuanfang-umzugshelfer` target is CHECKED** under "Add to targets." This is vital for Xcode to compile and link the files.
        *   Click **"Add"**.

3.  **Clean Build Folder and Restart Xcode:**
    *   After you have added all these files, go to Xcode's menu bar: `Product` -> `Clean Build Folder`.
    *   Quit Xcode completely (`Xcode` -> `Quit Xcode`).
    *   Reopen Xcode and try building your project again.

## Instructions for AI:

**Context:** The user is encountering compilation errors because Xcode is not recognizing all source code files. The `project.pbxproj` file, which defines the Xcode project structure, is highly sensitive and prone to corruption when modified directly via string replacement tools.

**Constraint:** Direct programmatic modification of `project.pbxproj` using simple string `replace` operations has proven unreliable and has previously led to project corruption. Therefore, **do not attempt to programmatically add files to the Xcode project by modifying `project.pbxproj` directly.**

**Action:** If the user requests to add files to the Xcode project, provide the human instructions above. Explain that this manual process is the safest and most reliable method to ensure project integrity. If a more sophisticated, Xcode-project-aware tool becomes available in the future, that would be the appropriate way to automate this task.
